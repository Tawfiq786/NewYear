        <h1>The Message!</h1>
        <p id="sub-text">Hey Habibi! Here you are at last :) I could have text messaged you directly about this, but it wouldn't have been very interesting, would it? That's why I decided to make this for you! Nonetheless, now that you are here, let's begin. Let me share with you a few things before we begin this new year. Firstly, I would like to thank you for coming into my life, since you have been here, this place has become even better! It makes me feel so much better to have you around. It's mainly because I was making this surprise for you that I haven't given you a lot of time and attention. However, I want you to know that whenever I worked on this, even now, I think of you and smile. As for me, I'd like this year of my life to be the best. I'd like it to decide my future with you. I'd like it to be a happy and peaceful one. All that I want to share with you! Although there is still a long way to go before we meet, I know it will be a special moment. It has only been a few days since I started spending time with you, but I am already so comfortable with you. I do not want this to end. I pray that we remain together, that we make it through any challenges together, with courage and love. Say Ameen basi :) I hope you have an amazing New Year! With love, Arab.</p>
